## Setting up the Environment

- Installed the required Python dependencies from the provided `requirements.txt` file.
- Created a new Python virtual environment and activated it.
- Installed the necessary libraries, including `llama-index` and `o-llama`.

## Installing and Configuring o-llama

- Downloaded and installed the o-llama tool, which allows running open-source language models locally.
- Tested the o-llama installation by running the `mistol` language model.

## Creating the Main Application

- Imported the necessary modules from `llama-index` and `o-llama` to work with the language models and data.
- Defined a function to read the contents of a PDF file using `llama-parse`, a tool for parsing complex documents.
- Created a vector store index to efficiently query the loaded data.

## Building the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Agent

- Implemented a `QueryEngineTool` to provide the agent with access to the vector store index.
- Created a `CodeReaderTool` to allow the agent to read the contents of Python code files.
- Constructed a `ReactAgent` that can utilize the various tools to answer prompts.

## Parsing and Saving the Generated Code

- Implemented a `CodeOutput` class to define the expected format of the generated code.
- Created a `JsonPromptTemplate` to guide the parsing of the agent's output.
- Developed a `QueryPipeline` to handle the multi-step process of generating and parsing the code.
- Added error handling and file saving functionality to the application.
